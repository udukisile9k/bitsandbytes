# Installation

Note currently `bitsandbytes` is only supported on CUDA GPU hardwares, support for AMD GPUs and M1 chips (MacOS) is coming soon.

<hfoptions id="OS system">
<hfoption id="Linux">

## Hardware requirements:
 - LLM.int8(): NVIDIA Turing (RTX 20xx; T4) or Ampere GPU (RTX 30xx; A4-A100); (a GPU from 2018 or newer).
 - 8-bit optimizers and quantization: NVIDIA Kepler GPU or newer (>=GTX 78X).

Supported CUDA versions: 10.2 - 12.0  #TODO: check currently supported versions

## Linux

### From Pypi

```bash
pip install bitsandbytes
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
CUDA_VERSION=XXX make cuda12x
python setup.py install
```

with `XXX` being your CUDA version, for <12.0 call `make cuda 11x`. Note support for non-CUDA GPUs (e.g. AMD, Intel), is also coming soon.

## Windows

Currently for Windows users, you need to build bitsandbytes from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes.git && cd bitsandbytes/
cmake -B build -DBUILD_CUDA=ON -S .
cmake --build build --config Release
python -m build --wheel
```

## MacOS

Mac support is still a work in progress. Please make sure to check out the [Apple Silicon implementation coordination issue](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/1020) to get notified about the discussions and progress with respect to MacOS integration.
